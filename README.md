# **Dynamic Memory Allocation Simulation**  

Welcome to the Dynamic Memory Allocation Simulation project! This project implements the **Best Fit** algorithm to allocate memory blocks dynamically based on the process sizes. The program is built using **Java** and is designed to provide a clear understanding of how the Best Fit algorithm works in memory management.

## **Introduction**  
This project is a simulation of memory allocation using the **Best Fit** algorithm. It:  
- Allocates processes to memory blocks that minimize unused space.  
- Highlights the concept of fragmentation.  
- Outputs allocation results, showing which process is assigned to which memory block.  

### **Technology Stack**  
- Programming Language: **Java**  
- Development Environment: **Eclipse IDE**

## **Prerequisites**  
Before setting up the project, ensure the following are installed:  
- **Java JDK** (>= 11)  
- **Eclipse IDE** (or any compatible Java IDE)

## **Setup Instructions**  

### **Cloning the Repository**  
Clone the project repository to your local machine:  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/DynamicMemoryAllocation.git  
```  

### **Setting up in Eclipse IDE**  
1. Open **Eclipse IDE**.  
2. Go to `File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace`.  
3. Select the cloned repository folder and click **Finish**.  

---

## **Running the Program**  
1. Open the `DynamicMemoryAllocation` project in Eclipse.  
2. Navigate to the `src` folder and open the `miniproject.java` file.  
3. Run the program by clicking the **Run** button or pressing `Ctrl + F11`.  
4. Follow the prompts in the console to input memory blocks and process sizes.

## **Features**  
- **Dynamic Input:** Allows users to input memory block sizes and process requirements.  
- **Best Fit Allocation:** Efficiently allocates memory to minimize fragmentation.  
- **Detailed Output:** Displays process allocations with unallocated processes clearly marked.  
- **Error Handling:** Validates user input to prevent invalid entries.  

---

## **Future Enhancements**  
- Implement additional memory allocation algorithms like **First Fit** and **Worst Fit** for comparison.  
- Add a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for a better user experience.  
- Enable input and output through external files for easier batch processing.  
- Visualize memory usage with charts or diagrams.
